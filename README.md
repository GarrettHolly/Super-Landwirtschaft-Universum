# Super-Landwirtschaft-Universum

## **Core Gameplay Mechanics**

You start with a Farmer who will gain random stats that will be listed below and each stat increases profit gained within the stats, some being increased profit from crops or just flat increase of overall profit. The farm will spawn in with crops that will be ready to grow after 3 days at which point you can sell them and either upgarde the farm or purchase animals. You can upgarde your farm to increase its size allowing for more areas to grow crops and allowing you to purchase more animals. Each tier of farm holds 5 of each type of animal and 1 plot for crops. Each night predators can attack and kill your animals as well as each day allowing for predators to attack and kill your crops. Your crops can become sick but each day have a chance to be treated by your farmer to stop them from withering. As the game progresses pricing of upgrades as well as animals will increase.
